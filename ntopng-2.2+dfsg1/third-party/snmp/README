Hello Luca, I'm pleased to have received your email.  I generally use the GPL (when I remember to include a license, that is).

GPL might not be compatible with ntopng's license, but I think I would be happy to grant permission to ntopng to use parts of the code.

Hi Edmund,
I have looked at your https://github.com/ejrh/snmp and I would like to use code portions for ntopng, an open-source GPLV3 traffic monitoring application. I have not been able to understand what is the license you have used for distributing the code: can you please let me know?

Thanks Luca
